# Support ticket tracking
### By Lucas Bicalho 2022-01-21

That is my first Flutter project, that I did to learn the concepts of the framework and the dart.
The purpose were to build a dashboard to be displayed in TV, then I didn't look much at responsivity.


The main ideia is to visualize the time consumed by the team and its analysts, containing:

    - A progress bar of the sum of analysts time consumed.
    - An avatar for each analyst of the team, with a circular progress bar around its picture.

Also, have a visual Kanban to know how many tickets are existing in each board.

    - Each board has an indicator of the ticket's quantity, and the cards contain just the main information about the ticket.
